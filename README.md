## Project overview ðŸŽ‰
My very first app build in Swift, weather app with the use of UiKit. In this project I have also used:
- CoreLocation
- CoreData (to keep user's saved locations)
- API from OpenWeather

Special thanks for icon set, which I have used in this project: <a href="https://icons8.com/icon/set/weather/fluent">Icons8</a>
